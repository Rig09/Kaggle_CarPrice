# Kaggle_CarPrice

This is a data analytical practice problem. I pulled the data from Kaggle. 

The dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho/data

In CarPriceDataEngineering, I do some short analysis of the data, here I make decisions on feature engineering that I will use for modeling in the subsequent files. I print some CSVs to show results. They can also be found. 

In CarPriceModel, I try a couple of models on my dataset after feature engineering. I look at MSE and R^2 and print the predictions to CSV files to see general trends. Those CSV files can be found along side the jupyter notebook files.
